            <p>Linear programming has a large number of applications. Any textbook on operations research
                is filled with examples of linear programming, and it is now a standard tool taught to students
                in most business schools. The election scenario is one typical example. Two more examples
                of linear programming are the following: An airline wishes to schedule its flight crews. The Federal Aviation Administration
                imposes many constraints, such as limiting the number of consecutive hours that each
                crew member can work and insisting that a particular crew work only on one model of
                aircraft during each month. The airline wants to schedule crews on all of its flights
                using as few crew members as possible. An oil company wants to decide where to drill for oil. Siting a drill at a particular
                location has an associated cost and, based on geological surveys, an expected payoff
                of some number of barrels of oil. The company has a limited budget for locating new
                drills and wants to maximize the amount of oil it expects to find, given this budget. Linear programming has a large number of applications. Any textbook on operations research
